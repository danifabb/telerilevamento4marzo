# Author: Maia Guerra

# With this code I want to check the changes in land cover, with special regard to vegetation, in the area of Yellowstone  
# National Park (YNP) from wolf reintroduction on 12th January 1995 until now, 2022. To do this, I decided to use NASA Landsat
# satellite images, which had a good resolution for the area I was interested in: YNP has an area of 8.991 kmÂ² while Landsat 
# resolution is 30 meters, which is definitely a good value.
# I've obtained the images of Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS for images of 2015 and 2022, and Landsat 4-5 TM for images of 1995,
# both from landsat 2 - collection 2 on USGS EarthExplorer website. The area I'm going to survey is the National Park itself,
# centered in north-west Wyoming, including a smaller surface of Montana on the north and Idaho on the west.
# To better check the situation of vegetation, the images were selected for each year during the summer period, from the last
# half of July until the end of August. This selection was also due to the images quality, which sometimes had too high 
# percentage of cloud cover and could not be selected for the analysis of this work. The selected images are then cut to be
# centered on the study area, using the code. 
# With this code I will do 3 different analysis: a time series analysis, from 1995, to visualize the changes and the 
# situation after 20 years in 2015, and finally the situation nowadays; I will calculate some spectral indices like DVI and NDVI 
# to highlight places were there have been changes in vegetation and check the health of vegetation; finally, a land cover 
# analysis, to check eventually an increase or decrease in vegetation cover in the 3 years selected (1995, 2015 and 2022).
# This code is divided in 2 main parts: Part I is the import and preparation of data, Part II is about the 3 analysis I made on
# these data. Each one has 3 sections.

##### 2 - IMAGE IMPORT AND CREATION OF THE RASTERBRICKS #####


### 2.1 - 1995 images ###

# Raster brick for 1995: import of each image containing a band from 1 to 4 (B1=blue, B2=green, B3=red, B4=NIR) and creation of
# the raster brick. This images were taken on August 27th, 1995.

l1995_B1 <- raster("images_1995/LT05_L2SP_038029_19950827_20200912_02_T1_SR_B1.tif") # B1

# Creation of the list to apply function stack.
list1995 <- list(l1995_B1, l1995_B2, l1995_B3, l1995_B4)

# Creation of the raster brick. All the images imported will be assembled and overlapped as layers of a unique image.
lan1995 <- stack(list1995)
lan1995 # check of the correct creation of the image.
plot(lan1995)

# Plot of natural color image with plotRGB function.
plotRGB(lan1995, 3, 2, 1, stretch="hist")
# Numbers 3, 2, 1 in this order define r=3, g=2, b=1, so each color is represented by the right band, giving the natural aspect
# of the image. Argument stretch="hist" stretches the values to increase the contrast of the image and better notice the
# differences between vegetation, water, snow and bare soil.

# Plot of NIR (Near InfraRed) in the red band (B3).
plotRGB(lan1995, 4, 3, 2, stretch="hist")


### 2.2 - 2015 images ###

# Creation of the raster brick from 2015 images. These ones were selected on August 2nd among all 2015 images because of the 
# tidiness from fog, clouds or any other atmospheric obstacle. Landsat 8-9 captures images with red, green, blue and NIR bands
# shifted of +1 number compared to Landsat 4-5, so here the bands are: B1=ultrablue, B2=blue, B3=green, B4=red, B5=NIR.
# I didn't need B1 band for my analysis so I did not consider it in the building of the raster brick.
# To have the same bands in raster bricks from 2015 and 2022 as in the one from 1995, I used bands 2, 3, 4 and 5, instead of 
# 1, 2, 3, and 4 as before.
l2015_B2 <- raster("images_2015/LC08_L2SP_038029_20150802_20200908_02_T1_SR_B2.tif") # B2

lan2015 # Check of correct creation of the image.

# Plot of NIR in the red band.

### 2.3 - 2022 images ###

# Creation of the raster brick from 2022 images. These were selected on 20th July for the same reason mentioned for 2015 images.
# Here again the bands used are B2, B3, B4 and B5.
l2022_B2 <- raster("images_2022/LC08_L2SP_038029_20220720_20220725_02_T1_SR_B2.tif") # B2
l2022_B3 <- raster("images_2022/LC08_L2SP_038029_20220720_20220725_02_T1_SR_B3.tif") # B3

lan2022

#Plot of NIR in the red band.
plotRGB(lan2022, 4, 3, 2, stretch="hist")





##### 3 - CUTTING OF THE IMAGES FROM EACH YEAR IN THE SAME AREA #####


### 3.1 Cutting of the 3 images ###

# The area I am interested to analyse is much smaller than the full satellite image. To cut out only this area, I used
# drawExtent function (from raster package) to select a square around it, using the cursor on the plot of the 1995 image.
# The square has georeferenced coordinates at its vertexes, so it could be applied also to the other 2 images from 2015
# and 2022. After this operation I've applied the cut on the 3 images using function crop and I've obtained 3 images 
# centered on exactly the same area.

# !! ATTENTION !!: Do not run the following part in curly brackets while reproducing the code, because it requires the square
# to be re-drawn. I've saved the new created images later in the code to use them for the analyses.
# {
# Creation of the cutting square with drawExtent function.
redsquare <- drawExtent(show=T, col="red")
# Cut of the first image (1995) with crop function.
lan1995sq <- crop(lan1995, redsquare) # In the object name "sq" is for "square".
# Plot of the image to check the right cutting.
plotRGB(lan1995sq, 4, 3, 2, stretch="hist")

# Applying of the same cut to the remaining 2 images.
lan2015sq <- crop(lan2015, redsquare)
plotRGB(lan2015sq, 4, 3, 2, stretch="hist")
lan2022sq <- crop(lan2022, redsquare)
plotRGB(lan2022sq, 4, 3, 2, stretch="hist")

# Saving all the new images as .jpg for the next analyses. Exporting in this format (.jpg) saves only the first 3 bands of each
# image, so I saved plots with NIR in the red band and red in the green band to be able to use them in the next analyses.

### 3.2 Solving a little problem of cloud cover for 1995 image ### 

# After cutting all the images centered on the study area, I realized that the cover of clouds in 1995 image caused the loss
# of too much data on the type of land cover at the bottom half of the image. To fix this problem, I've searched USGS website 
# for other images from 1995, caught in the same period of the year, and having less cloud cover in the bottom area of the image.
# The only other good image of the same area without cloud cover I could find was from 26th July, quite a month before the 1995
# image I used at first, from 27th August. Unfortunately, this image had some clouds covering too, but at the top half part of it.
# So, to have an image as clear as possible from 1995, I decided to cut the portions without cloud cover from the 2 images, and
# then put them together using the code.

# Import of the second image from 26th July 1995.

##### 5 - SPECTRAL INDICES #####


### 5.1 DVI (Difference Vegetation Index) ###

# DVI is an absolute index that represents the "greenness" of the environment. It is calculated by subtracting the red band from the NIR band.

# In portions of the image clear from vegetation, DVI is of course low. So, knowing this, if we have a satellite image we can check the changes
# in vegetation cover in a particular area.

### 5.2 NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) ###

# NDVI is the index that comes from normalization of DVI, to make it comparable. It is calculated dividing DVI for NIR + red bands of an image,

# already comparable between different images.

###### 6 - LAND COVER #####


# To calculate the land cover I need to work just on one layer. Since my images are made of more than one, I need to "build" this 
# layer using the code and starting from the layers of each image. To do so, I decided to apply unsuperClass function on the raster
# images created from DVI analysis, that distinguished better the levels of reflectance in the images. This allowed me to identify
# the vegetation: in a satellite raster image that shows DVI, vegetation correspond to the pixels with the highest values. So, using
# 3 classes for the clustering of this image with unsuperClass, I am able to group all of them out of the total pixels of the image,
# considering only the class with the highest value. This is possible by using freq function on the map of the model created by
# unsupeClass. Finally, to calculate the land cover change, I made a ratio between the pixels corresponding to vegetation and the total
# number of pixels for each image.


### 6.1 Creation of the model with unsuperClass ###

##1995
l1995uc <- unsuperClass(dvi1995, nClasses = 3)
plot(l1995uc$map, main="1995")

## 2015
l2015uc <- unsuperClass(dvi2015, nClasses = 3)
plot(l2015uc$map, main="2015")

## 2022
l2022uc <- unsuperClass(dvi2022, nClasses = 3)
plot(l2022uc$map, main="2022")


### 6.2 Calculation of the total amount of pixels for each class in the 3 images ###

freq(l1995uc$map) # class 2 (vegetation) = 64339
freq(l2015uc$map) # class 1 (vegetation) = 61238
freq(l2022uc$map) # class 3 (vegetation) = 56345

# Total pixel of each image
totpix <- 230400

# Total forest pixels of the 3 images.
forestpix1995 <- 64339 # 1995
forestpix2015 <- 61238 # 2015
forestpix2022 <- 56345 # 2022


### 6.3 Calculation of the percentage of forest cover in the 3 years ###

## 1995
perc_forest_1995 <- (forestpix1995/totpix)*100
perc_forest_1995 # The percentage of forest cover in 1995 is 27.92491 ~ 27,92 ~ 28%

## 2015
perc_forest_2015 <- (forestpix2015/totpix)*100
perc_forest_2015 # The percentage of forest cover in 2015 is 26.57899 ~ 26,6%

## 2022
perc_forest_2022 <- (forestpix2022/totpix)*100
perc_forest_2022 # The percentage of forest cover in 2022 is 24.4553 ~ 24,5%

# Calculation of the decrease in forest cover.
decrease1995_2015 <- 28-26.6
decrease1995_2015
decrease2015_2022 <- 26.6-24.5
decrease2015_2022


### 6.4 Final plot of the changing of forest cover ###

# From this last analysis we can see how the forest cover has changed during the years. In the first 20 years from 1995 to 2015 it has decreased
# of 1,4%, while from 2015 to 2022 it has decreased of 2,1%. Let's do a plot to better see this decrease through the years.

# Building of the dataframe. 
year <- c("1995", "2015", "2022")
forest_cover <- c(28, 26.6, 24.5)
forest_cover_df <- data.frame(year, forest_cover)

# Creation of the plot and final export.
jpeg(filename="Forest cover decrease from 1995 to 2022.jpg", width=1000, height=600)
plot(forest_cover_df, main="Forest cover decrease from 1995 to 2022", xlab="Year", ylab="Forest cover %", pch=16, 
     cex=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL, lty = 2, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
axis(1, at = year, labels = year)
lines(year, forest_cover, col = "red", lty = 1, lwd = 2)
dev.off()

# From this last plot we can see that the trend of forest cover change is negative: it has decreased quite fast in the first 20 years of the
# analysis, and even faster in the last 7 years.
